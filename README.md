## Introduction
The "Crafting Interpreters" ebook serves as the foundation for this project, guiding the implementation of a fully functional interpreter. The focus is on understanding the principles of crafting interpreters and applying them using plain C.

Check: [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the interpreter up and running:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/imbianchi/clox.git`
2. Navigate to lox project directory: `cd clox/`
3. Build the solution: `make all`
4. Run the interpreter: `./clox` or `./clox testFile.clox`

## Usage
Once the interpreter is running, you can input your own programs or use the provided examples from the *Crafting Interpreters* ebook. Explore the source code to gain insights into the interpreter's implementation details.
